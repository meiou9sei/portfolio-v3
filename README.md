# portfolio-v3

will be live at: https://camerona.vvampa.to/ (currently hosts v2)

goals:

- new site design
- clean code (v2 was a bit messy)
- cooler-looking and technically impressive 3D portfolio to show off ability, personality, and work
- dynamic urls to show off projects both code and 3d

past portfolio versions:
